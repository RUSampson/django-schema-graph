# Changelog for django-schema-graph

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- Ability to dynamically change the apps and models being displayed via a new
  sidebar.
- Colours. So many pretty colours.

## [0.0.2]

### Changed
- Hopefully nothing other than version number. This tests automatic releases to
  PyPI with GitHub actions.

## [0.0.1]

### Added
- Basic schema graph. Interactive, but no dynamic data yet. Tested with Django
  1.8, and 1.11-3.0 on Python 2.7 and 3.5+ (where those combinations make sense).
